				Bands, and volume analysis to generate buy and sell signals. It pulls real-time market data from the Binance
				API and executes strategies to optimize trading opportunities. A paper trading feature is included to test
				strategies risk-free before going live, showcasing my skills in algorithm development, automated trading
				systems, and data analysis.

				This is a collaborative project involving the use
				of Caesar and Vigenere ciphers in the application of encryption
				and decryption of single words. Within the project, encryption/
				decryption is visualized, encryption/decryption times are
				measured, and a bit of bruteforce/dictionary hacking is done to
				test the encryption strength of each cipher.
